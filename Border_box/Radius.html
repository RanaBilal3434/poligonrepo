    <p class="atom">
        Atoms 0f radioactive elements can split.
     According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances.
     When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission.
        In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy.
     Thus the energy released cannot do much damage.</p>

     <p class="explosion">
    However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process.
     Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process.
     This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy.
      This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion.
      Hence, atoms do not literally explode.
     They generate energy that can cause explosions.
