        Atoms of radioactive elements can split.
     According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances.
     When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission.
        In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy.
     Thus the energy released cannot do much damage.</div>
                                  </center>
     <div class="explosion">
     However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process.
     Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process.
     This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy.
      This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion.
      Hence, atoms do not literally explode.</div>
      <P class="bom">
     They generate energy that can cause <b> explosions. </b>   </p>
